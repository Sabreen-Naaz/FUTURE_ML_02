# Support Ticket Classification System (Machine Learning)

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of the **Future Interns – Machine Learning Internship (Task 2)**.  
The goal of this project is to automatically classify customer support tickets into
different categories such as **Technical, Billing, and Account**, helping support teams
respond faster and more efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Customer support teams receive a large number of tickets daily. Manually reading and
assigning categories is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project uses **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to
automatically classify support tickets based on their text.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- TF-IDF Vectorizer  

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow
1. Created a dataset of support tickets with categories  
2. Cleaned and preprocessed text data  
3. Converted text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorization**  
4. Trained a **Machine Learning classification model**  
5. Predicted the category of new support tickets  

---

## 📊 Output
- The model predicts ticket categories such as:
  - Technical
  - Billing
  - Account
- This helps in automatic ticket routing and prioritization.
