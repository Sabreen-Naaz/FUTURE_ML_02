# 🎯 Support Ticket Classification & Prioritization

Machine Learning Task 2 – Future Interns (2026)  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds an NLP-based Machine Learning system that:

- Classifies support tickets into categories (Ticket Type)
- Predicts ticket priority (High / Medium / Low)
- Helps businesses automate ticket routing and improve response time
